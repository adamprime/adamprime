# 👋 Hi there, I'm Adam Tervort

I'm a people-centered systems builder who helps remote teams work better—especially in complex, cross-functional environments. 

Over the past 15+ years, I’ve led support, engineering, operations, HR, and internal tooling initiatives at a cybersecurity startup, helping it grow from scrappy beginnings to enterprise scale. My work often lives at the intersection of process design, team culture, and the tech that connects them.

### 🛠️ What I’m Great At

- Designing internal systems and workflows that scale with people
- Building documentation, training, and enablement from scratch
- Turning friction-heavy ops into calm, sustainable systems
- Leading people-first teams across time zones and tools

This GitHub profile features a mix of:
- ⚙️ DevOps and infrastructure scripts  
- 🧰 Internal tooling prototypes  
- 📖 Markdown writing systems  
- 🤖 AI + automation experiments (and maybe a salty octopus or two 🐙)

Most of my repos are private, but I'll make some public as I go.

### 👀 Currently

I’m exploring full-time opportunities where I can bring structure, clarity, and momentum to internal operations, product enablement, or cross-functional systems work.
